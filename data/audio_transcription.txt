 business versus self-employment. It's very important if you want to have your own business to understand the difference between a business and self-employment. Self-employment is what most people create when they try to make their own business. Self-employment is basically a job. The only difference is that you no longer have a boss. You are both the boss and the employee. Certainly self-employment is more fun than working for someone else, but it has many problems. The biggest problem is overwork. For example, many lawyers are self employed, but they work too much. 50. 60. 70 or more hours a week in many ways they don't own their business. Their business owns them. When self-employed you're basically doing the same job you used to do for someone else. A key trait of self-employment is that your business only makes money when you work. If you take a vacation, your business stops making money or makes less. A true business is different. It's not the same as a job. A business is an organization of systems. It continues to work even when you are not working or present. You create systems by automating your business and or training others to do parts of it. Your goal is to create a business that can run without you. Ideally, you should be able to disappear for six months and the business continue working well while you're gone. This is easier said than done. You accomplish this you must organize every part of your business. You must simplify all tasks and train people to accomplish them easily. You must create a strong, clear management system. You must automate every part of the business that you can so that things happen automatically.
